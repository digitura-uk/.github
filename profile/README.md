## 👋 Hi there — welcome to: [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Digitura.uk‑on‑GitHub-181717?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/digitura-uk)

Digitura.uk is a software lab focused on building clean, fast, AI‑powered tools.

We’re exploring ideas, workflows, and infrastructure using:

⚙️ **React** · **Next.js** · **Supabase** · **n8n**  
🧠 **Langflow** · **Cursor** · **Cloudflare** · more...

Our aim?  
To make automation accessible — and fun — with minimal code and maximum clarity.

This space includes:

- 🧪 Experiments in automation, prompt design, and AI workflows  
- 📦 Public tools and starter kits (like Emoji Box)  
- 📓 Notes and blueprints as we go

We’re building quietly, but intentionally.  
No hype. Just flow.

📦 Public tools and starter kits — like [Emoji Box](https://github.com/digitura-uk/cool-emoji-box)
